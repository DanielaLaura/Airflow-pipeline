# Airflow-pipeline

Work in progress...

- Airflow can only be installed on Linux os, so if you use Windows, then you'll have to use a VM (I personally use Oracle VM VirtualBox).
- As an OS I choose the CentOS Linux Version 7 because it suports containerization tools such as Kubernetes and Docker; CentOS open-source and free, and you can download it directly from their website and burn it on dvd/usb or download the os image from a mirror in your region.

-You can find the VM setup and airflow/docker/hadoop instalation here: ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXUuhgjOa4&feature=youtu.be
